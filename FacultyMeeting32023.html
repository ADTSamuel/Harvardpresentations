            The most outstanding result of the PhD thesis by Eslam Khalaf is the exact solution of the long standing problem of the dynamics of quasi-1D Anderson localization.  Basic equations describing  such dynamics were formulated  in 1983 by Efetov and Larkin.  It took 34 years until Eslam Khalaf was able to present an exact solution to these equations in a compact and very practical form.<br><br>

            Considering condensed matter theorists whose work is guided by a taste for experimental relevance, I cannot think of any other junior candidate I would rank above [Eslam].<br><br>
            Eslam is the sort of broad physicist who can pivot from deriving topological terms in a field theory to having the patience to understand the details relevant to experiment - and he has chosen a very exciting field in which he can naturally relate the two.<br><br>
            I have observed [Eslam] to be one of the most disciplined and hardworking collaborators I've ever worked with - I can message him for help and insight essentially any hour of night or day.<br><br>

            One of the key requirements for the position at Harvard is the highest quality of the research. In my view, Eslam fully satisfies this requirement. He is exceptionally talented, highly productive, and has a track record of high-quality papers. He is stronger than anyone I know from his age group.<br><br>
            Several of his articles in APS journals have been selected as “Editor’s suggestions”.  As I wrote, Eslam is surely one of the best, if not the best theoretical physicist of his generation.

            Very impressive candidate. In great command of the field, with lots of exciting ideas.  He would be a great student mentor (at least in the projects he would have), and would work very well with experimentalists.<br><br>
            If I had to rank them, taking into consideration and the departmental needs at the moment, I would put Eslam Khalaf and Elise Novitski at the top, in this order because of departmental needs.<br><br>

            Over the past one and a half decades as a faculty member at Harvard and at UC Berkeley, I have had the good fortune of working with some truly excellent postdocs who then successfully moved on to faculty positions at top institutions. Eslam ranks among the very best of this group and in addition he is conscientious and has high emotional maturity, which would make him an excellent colleague. He gives beautiful talks and would be an excellent teacher. He is showing every sign of success as a junior faculty at UT Austin, successfully working with students and experimental colleagues, helping to hire and recruit a new CMT theorist there while producing research `home-runs’. I am happy to recommend him in the strongest and the most enthusiastic terms.<br><br>

            In this work, published in <i style="font-style: italic !important"> Nature Comm</i> in 2019, Eslam explained the possible spin-triplet superconductivity scenario in TDBG due to ferromagnetic order fluctuation.  Experimental realization of this theoretical work just came in the last year, published in <i style="font-style: italic !important"> Nature</i> 2020, where Eslam played the reading role in theoretical analysis.<br><br>
            Another seminal work that Eslam did is Magic angle hierarchy in twisted graphene multilayers (published in <i style="font-style: italic !important"> PRB</i>, 2019). He predicted the appearance of flat bands together with the Dirac dispersion in twisted trilayer graphene with opposite angles. Following this theoretical prediction, my group and independently Pablo Jarillo-Herrero's group at MIT performed the experimental study in this alternatively stacked twisted trilayer graphene recently, discovered such a system's experimental realization, together with a robust presence of superconductivity. The Harvard side of the work is published in <i style="font-style: italic !important"> Science </i> this year (2021), where Eslam was one of the key contributors, especially in theoretical analysis.<br><br>

            I would like to share my colleagues' views that condensed matter theory (CMT) is an area of our department requiring urgent growth. Based on a discussion with senior colleagues, it is my understanding that the last junior CMT hire was Eugene Demler, which was about 20 years ago. Having a new junior colleague in this area would be particularly impactful for the health of our graduate and undergraduate programs, as well as for enhancing the impact of condensed matter experiments in our Department. Beyond the need of an additional condensed matter theorist, I would also like to mention that of the three areas considered for this year's hiring cycle, CMT is the one adding the least strain to the current space demands in our Department.<br><br>
        [Eslam] seemed to me the most promising of the CMT candidates. Eslam presented polished talk and chalk talk, and seemed genuinely interested in a variety of topics spanning from twisted graphene to correlated electron systems, quasicrystals, disordered systems and nonequilibrium. He had a few questions for me in the one-on-one conversation and he gives the impression to be able to connect with experimentalists.<br><br>

            I think CMT is the most urgent need for the department. We effectively have 2 CMT advisers (Subir + Ashvin) but ~150 graduate applicants (114 explicitly CMT but 20 theory undecided, 13 computational, and 69 in quantum comp/info). On the other hand we have 4 high energy expt advisers (Melissa, John, Masahiro, Carlos) but only 79 applicants. In amo-ex, we just hired Giulia Semeghini and Norm Yao last year, so we have 6 amo-ex groups who will likely advise at least 10 students each, so I do not see a strong need.<br><br>
            I found [Eslam] full of ideas about every experiment I proposed, so it was a very exciting conversation for me. We hope to pursue some acoustic quasicrystals together. He seems to be a very thoughtful and upbeat and people-oriented person, and I think he would be a great addition to our department.<br><br>

            Condensed matter theory continues to generate stunning science with intimate connections to beautiful experiments. It does seem to me to be an area of crucial need in our Physics Department! Despite his continued productivity, Bert Halperin is ~55 years past his Ph.D. and has emeritus status, while Eugene Demler may not return. My own efforts are directed primarily at soft matter physics and physical biology. This leaves essentially only Ashvin Vishnawath and Subir Sachdev to carry the load in hbar-related manybody condensed matter theory, an thriving area where 4-5 theorists are typically needed (e.g., at places like MIT) to achieve critical mass. While their excellence as theoreticians is evident in many ways (including their connections to the top-ranked condensed matter theory candidates considered by the committee!) this excellence is quite fragile. Crucial teaching needs for experimental and theoretical condensed matter theory have become difficult to cover -- I myself was recruited to teach introductory graduate level solid state physics for the first time in 17 years in 2021 for this reason.

        Throughout the past 2-3 years my group has been performing compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer graphene and twisted trilayer graphene. One of our key discoveries was the observation of what is known as a fractional Chern insulator that has been predicted to exist even at zero magnetic field. This phase is a lattice analogue of a fractional quantum Hall phase that emerges at large magnetic fields. Our experiments revealed this phase at relatively low magnetic fields and we have engaged with Ashvin's group to understand the role of magnetic field and other system parameters as well as the competing phases that exist in its vicinity. Eslam participated in each one of our conversations and was always extremely insightful and commanding of the field. It is needless to say that many of his insights turned out to be very accurate and much of my intuition regarding the physics of these systems stems from my conversations with Eslam.<br><br>
        As an experimentalist, Eslam has exactly the qualities I would want in a theorist. He conveys complex and abstract ideas clearly and communicates extremely effectively with experimentalists. He is both curious about experimental observations and puzzles but also is a leader in predicting new and novel phenomena.<br><br>
